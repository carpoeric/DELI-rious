# DELI-RIOUS
"Thanks for visiting Delirious! Home of the most euphoric sandwiches in the world. How may I assist you?"

For this project, I created a POS (Point Of Sales, not to be confused with the Urban Dictionary abbreviation) system for a sandwich shop.

To operate this application, please read the given options and write the corresponding choices that are [boxed] when prompted to make an order. For further assistance, please feel free to take a look at the Screenshots section below for a detailed walk-through.


## Screenshots

- In the screenshot below, you will see a warm welcome to the application. Here, you can  start a new order followed by what You'd like to add to the order.

- After choosing to start an order, we can choose to, firstly, add a sandwich. With this option, we can order a pre-made signature sandwich or customize your own. At the end of the prompts, the sandwiches will be successfully added and will be shown.

- Once done, we get redirected back to the order screen. The next option would be to add a drink! Once entering "2", you are able to select the size and specific drink.

- After selecting the drink, we can grab some C H I P P I E S ! Who doesn't love chips?

- Now that your order has been built, your time with the POS system has come to an end. We can input 4 to check out and review your order details.

- Once done with everything, we can view the receipt in a seperate file.

- An interesting piece of code I had was trying to challenge myself in implementing a different way of displaying options to select. To do this, I decided to use descriptions for the Signature sandwiches and print it out for selection. You can see the Signature Sandwich screenshot abocve for the front end, but here is the back end of what it may look like.

## Thank you.
If you've reached the end of this README, I appreciate your time reading all of this! Some hindsight for this project, I wish I took more time making a better user interface for this similar in my previous projects. I do, however, like how everything turned out and how I kept it clean. Please feel free to reach out with any improvements, questions, or comments regarding this project!
